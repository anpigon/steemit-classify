■ Nothing Breaks Like A Heart[SINGLE] (RCA); Nov. 29, 2018

Nothing Breaks Like A Heart
This world can hurt youIt cuts you deep and leaves a scarThings fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heartAnd nothing breaks like a heart
I heard you on the phone last nightWe live and die by pretty liesYou know it, oh, we both know itThese silver bullet cigarettesThis burning house, there's nothing leftIt's smoking, we both know itWe got all night to fall in loveBut just like that we fall apartWe're broken, we're broken
Mmm, well nothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us now
Well, there's broken silenceBy thunder crashing in the dark (crash in the dark)And this broken recordSpin endless circles in the bar (spin 'round in the bar)This world can hurt youIt cuts you deep and leaves a scarThings fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heartMhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart
We'll leave each other cold as iceAnd high and dry, the desert windIs blowin', is blowin'Remember what you said to me?We were drunk in love in TennesseeAnd I hold it, we both know it
Mmm, nothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us nowNothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us now
Well, there's broken silenceBy thunder crashing in the dark (crash in the dark)And this broken recordSpin endless circles in the bar (spin 'round in the bar)This world can hurt youIt cuts you deep and leaves a scarThings fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mhmm, and nothing breaks like a heartNothing breaks like a heartMhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart
(My heart, my heart)Nothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us now(My heart, my heart)Nothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us now
Well, there's broken silenceBy thunder crashing in the dark (crash in the dark)And this broken recordSpin endless circles in the bar (spin 'round in the bar)This world can hurt youIt cuts you deep and leaves a scarThings fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heartMhmm, but nothing breaks like a heartBut nothing breaks like a heartMhmm, but nothing breaks like a heart
