■Calling My Spirit[SINGLE] (Dollaz N Dealz); Nov. 30, 2018

Calling My Spirit
I put my heart in my lyricsI gave it all I could giveI made it hot at the cribI kept that fire at the cribWhere you gon' go when you dip?How I'ma know who for real?I pour a four in a fifthYou already know what it isI keep a pole in the whip'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy meIt ain't no ho in the cliqueNone of my dawgs got fuckboy tendenciesI don't even show no sympathySipping on Hennessy, it got me bending sidewaysEverything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the waveNigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drankI done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel visionHad to open my mind, then I opened a BenzIt's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attentionFuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in itI had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm seriousAnd it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits
I put my Hublot on rocksI put moschato on rocksWhere I’m from we don’t say oppShoot at an OV, shoot at a copShoot at the police, shoot at your topI made a million off socksFree all my niggas who stuck in a boxLocked up and watching the clockLocked up, they fighting with locksLocked up, they swinging they knifesI can't be living this lifeNo more Bacardi, alrightI don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on iceMy vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menaceI'll show you I'm destined to get itI be outside with the glizzyToting that fire, I be trippin'I just might die how I'm livingAin't tell nobody, but I'm trippingNiggas ain't catching me slipping, ayy, yeahI make you laugh when you with meKnow that my swag is terrific (glee, glee)Ain't seen my dad in a minuteBut I can't be mad, I got millionsI just pulled up in a lemonThuggin', so fuck your opinionI'm thuggin', so fuck how you feelingI'm calling my spirit
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel visionHad to open my mind, then I opened a BenzIt's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attentionFuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in itI had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm seriousAnd it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits
